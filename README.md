CO₂ Emissions Dashboard 

This Tableau project visualizes global CO₂ emissions data to analyze how different countries and sectors have contributed to climate change over time. The dashboard provides clear insights into historical responsibility and current emission trends.

 Files Included

- `Co2_Emissions_Project.twbx` – Packaged Tableau Workbook containing the complete interactive dashboard
- `CO2_Emission (Tableau).csv` – Cleaned dataset used for creating the dashboard
- 'Tableau (Cleaning).ipynb'- Cleaning the csv dataset using python

Visualizations Included

- Line Chart – CO₂ emissions trend over the years
- Map View – Emissions by country
- Bar Chart – Sector-wise emissions
- Filters – Year, Country, and Emission Source
- Top 10 Emitters – Highlighting highest-contributing countries

Key Insights

- The top contributors to global CO₂ emissions over the last two decades
- How emissions have changed over time for developed vs. developing countries
- Which sectors (e.g., industry, transport, energy) dominate emissions

Purpose

The aim of this dashboard is to:
- Create awareness of global emission patterns
- Help understand historical responsibility in the climate crisis
- Support data-driven climate action

Tools Used
